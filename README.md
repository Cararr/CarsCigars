Visit [carscigars.pl](http://carscigars.pl/ "Polish version only") - a polish blog about cigars!


## Goal of creating this website

The purpose of this website was to practice my knowledge of html, css and basics of JS gained through [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) and Youtube channel [Pasja Informatyki](https://www.youtube.com/user/MiroslawZelent).

## About app

CarsCigars is a schema of a blog about one of my hobbies - smoking cigars. It is not a complete, ready blog, instead it only a sample of how it could look like. You can see the welcome page, enter a reviews tab and check out first and only review of a cigar called *Nasty Fritas*. I have used only pure html, css and js to create it, no bootstrap, no preprocessors, vanila JS (only used jQuery for one feature and i've tried the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) library). The website is responsive and looks well in mobile version too.

## Deployment

The site is hosted through Github Pages and the domain was bought on [Domena.pl](https://domeny.domena.pl/).

### Running the website on Your machine

`npm install`

### Disclaimer
[carscigars.pl](http://carscigars.pl/ "Polish version only") is only available in polish version.
